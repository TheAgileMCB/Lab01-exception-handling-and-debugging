# Lab01-exception-handling-and-debugging
Lab01 of DeltaV 401 covering Exception Handling and Debugging

**Run** this program from Visual Studio, and follow the prompts. You will be accessed to input a series of integers. Please, remain within the bounds of what is being asked for. You will experience some fancy math. Against an unpleasant and uncertain backdrop. Do not fear; vote.

**This program** runs in the VS console presently. Perhaps it will see a new life. Only the calendar can tell. It's purpose is to test my abilities as a C# beginner and with exception handling. It is simple, and, I think, straightforward.

**Thank you** to C# and Visual Studio for making this project possible. And thank you to the 2020 DeltaV cohort for their help and encouragement, Keith, Craig, and Ian for supporting us.

**And thanks** for listening.
